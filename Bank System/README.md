Here is one of my first major projects in C++

It is a banking software that can deposit,withdraw and transfer
Each account holder has a unique acc number.
I have used files as a means of database.

Not the cleanest code, but it is error free.
UI is definetly not the cleanest.

A clean and simple first project

Feel free to debug and analyze. Would love to hear any suggestion for changes,
Always happy to help in case of doubts.

Cheers!
