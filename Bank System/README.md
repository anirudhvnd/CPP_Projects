Here is one of first major projects in C++

It is a banking software that can deposit,withdraw and transfer
Each account holder has a unique acc number.
I have used files as a means of database.

Not the cleanest code, but it is error free.
UI is definetly not the cleanest and isa basis of what i have studied in C++

Feel free to debug and analyze. Would love to hear any suggestion for changes

Cheers!
